## Setup

> Provide instructions on how to set up the development environment for the project, including installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and running the project.

- Clone the repository: 
```bash
  git clone 
```
- Open the `PlannerService.slnx` using Visual Studio 2026 or JetBrains Rider
- Configure the database connection string in `appsettings.json`

```
"UseInMemoryDatabase": false,
```

- Start the project using Visual Studio 2026 or JetBrains Rider

## Using Real Database

## Installing the tools

`dotnet ef` can be installed as either a global or local tool. Most developers prefer installing `dotnet ef` as a global tool using the following command:

```bash  
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```  
To use it as a local tool, restore the dependencies of a project that declares it as a tooling dependency using a tool manifest file.

Update the tool using the following command:

```bash  
dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
```  

## Verify installation

Run the following commands to verify that EF Core CLI tools are correctly installed:

```bash  
dotnet ef
```  

The output from the command identifies the version of the tools in use:

```bash  

                     _/\__
               ---==/    \\
         ___  ___   |.    \|\
        | __|| __|  |  )   \\\
        | _| | _|   \_/ |  //|\\
        |___||_|       /   \\\/\\

```  

## Database Migrations
To use `dotnet-ef` for your migrations first ensure that `UseInMemoryDatabase` is disabled, as described within previous section. Then, add the following flags to your command (values assume you are executing from repository root)

- `--project src/Infrastructure (optional if in this folder)`
- `--startup-project src/WebAPI`
- `--output-dir Persistence/Migrations`

For example, to add a new migration from the root folder:
```bash  
dotnet ef migrations add "MainMigration" --project src\Infrastructure --startup-project src\WebAPI --output-dir Persistence\Migrations
```  

To update the database:
```bash  
dotnet ef database update "MainMigration" --project src\Infrastructure --startup-project src\WebAPI
```
Get the list of migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations list --project src\Infrastructure --startup-project src\WebAPI
```
